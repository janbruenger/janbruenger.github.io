            <p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">To Jan and John Bruenger:</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addendum:&nbsp; This is about YOU and what YOU have done.&nbsp; Shame
 on you for continuing to trick others into fighting your battles.&nbsp;
 YOU take responsibility for YOUR conduct, YOUR lies.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 am writing this open letter regarding numerous matters to which, for 
years, you have never responded or refused to respond, have repeatedly 
lied about, or have shown abusive conduct—particularly towards members 
of my family.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 am writing this in an open forum as a last recourse for requesting 
answers, many of which I've sought since the day you separated me from 
my family, yet you have never responded to.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Yes.&nbsp;
 You continue to offer round and categorical "denials".&nbsp; &nbsp;You 
do this with no accountability for your conduct, your willful abuse and 
your isolation of my family members from me and refusal for any 
reasonable reconciliation for the past sixteen years.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">It's
 been your willful intent to poison others against me, and use the very 
fact that I attempt to communicate or beg you for visits, which you 
continued to deny until those involved were adults -- and now you blame 
them for this.&nbsp; Shame on you and John, both.&nbsp; We never 
deserved this, never deserved to be ripped apart and kept from each 
other.&nbsp; None of us deserved to be lied to about the circumstance --
 you libelled me to care providers in front of us, so you could further 
pretend these lies you told in secret were true.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">When
 you accused me of this while I was on the phone, you refused to even 
let me respond before taking the phone and shouting over me until you 
hung up.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 asked you before why you did this, why you separated me from my family 
and kept us apart for an entire childhood, never even letting us see 
each other sometimes as few as once or twice a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
answer you gave me, and I quote:</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<strong><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">"I
 took him and am keeping him from you because you took my daughter from 
me!&nbsp; When my mother died!&nbsp; And you moved to Springfield!"</span></span></strong></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">This is the only answer you have ever given me.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 responded, kindly.&nbsp; You were screaming at me as if I had done 
something wrong asking to be in the life of my family.&nbsp; I calmly 
explained to you that we moved to Springfield because I was able to get 
student loans at the university there.&nbsp; Because your daughter and I
 wanted to continue our education, even though you would not allow it.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Because
 when your daughter got pregnant, you immediately forced her to quit 
school.&nbsp; She begged and begged, but you cut off her funding, made 
her quit taking classes, quit paying for her student housing, forced her
 to move home.<br>
She was doing great in art school.&nbsp; She would have done great.&nbsp; What could have been.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">And
 you kept us apart because we moved to get away from your controlling 
financial influence.&nbsp; This is the only answer you have ever 
given.&nbsp; Other than the simple and easy lie to accuse me of, because
 I'm a man, that I certainly must have been violent.&nbsp; But—there’s 
no record of this in my history, no record on paper or person, no one 
has ever accused me of this—except you.&nbsp; Privately.&nbsp; Where you
 don’t allow me to respond, but continue to influence others with your 
slander.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 have the support for what I have to say, the many questions I have to 
ask.&nbsp; You can continue to choose not to respond.&nbsp; It is not 
going to stop me from asking, from asking you to stop isolating me from 
my family.&nbsp; What you have done, what you are doing, is wrong.&nbsp;
 I don't pretend to be perfect—but you do.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">The "Agreement"</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">In
 2011 you and John signed a visitation agreement I had demanded be put 
in place before allowing you any rights regarding my family.&nbsp; 
During this time you kept us separated without my consent, refusing to 
allow visitation outside of your home.&nbsp; There were long periods 
when I was denied any contact, despite my legal rights.&nbsp; This is 
addressed in The Kidnapping section.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">This
 visitation agreement stated that while I lived in the state of 
Missouri, I would have regular visits every other weekend.&nbsp; After 
months of fighting you back and forth in court over the phrasing of the 
agreement, the agreement was finally signed, notarized, and entered into
 the court record.<br>
Then your lawyer argued to the court: "This cannot be enforced.&nbsp; 
There is no enforcement law for visitation agreements made in probate 
court."&nbsp; We continued trying to fight this in court, but ultimately
 there was nothing I could do.&nbsp; At that time, before 2019, there 
were no laws to enforce visitation in guardianship cases.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">It
 was June of 2011 before we had to give up the fight, because your money
 won out over my right to be with my family.&nbsp; I had moved from St. 
Louis back to my home in February, and by the time the guardianship 
matter was forced to a close, you had already told me flatly that you 
would not be following the agreement, that my parent's house was "too 
far away to visit every other weekend."&nbsp; It's only a three hour 
drive.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">The visits you promised in writing, the visits you signed, the Word of Jan and John Bruenger, were immediately made lies.</span></span></strong></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why,
 Jan, when you and John signed papers that I could have regular visits 
every other weekend, did you never allow more than a handful of visits a
 year, as a rule?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why, Jan, for the two years while I lived with my parents, did you refuse to follow the visitation agreement?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why, Jan, for the next sixteen years, did you never allow me to have visits in my own home?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why, Jan, for sixteen years, did you only allow visits at my parent's home?</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">And, making it even worse, you lied about it.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">When
 questions were raised about why I wasn't able to see my family more, I 
hesitated to tell the truth—that you solely were responsible for 
refusing to follow the visitation agreement you and John signed. And, 
what did you do?</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">You
 told others this was a lie.&nbsp; You told them that it was my fault 
that I didn't get to see my family more, you invented this story and 
said, "The court made the visitation agreement null and void when you 
moved out of state!"</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Except,
 I didn't move out of state until two years later.&nbsp; I lived with my
 parents then—and you refused to follow the agreement you signed.&nbsp; 
Eventually I moved just outside of Kansas City, and this didn't change 
anything.&nbsp; You didn't let me have any more or fewer than a handful 
of visits a year, whether I was in Missouri or not.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
 agreement you and John signed, the Word of John and Jan Bruenger, said 
that "Guardians should consider allowing visits out of state."&nbsp; You
 never did this.&nbsp; You never allowed the promised agreements when I 
was in Missouri.&nbsp; You never allowed visits in my home.<br>
You lied.&nbsp; You signed the agreement, knowing it was a lie, knowing 
your lawyer would block it, knowing it couldn't be enforced.&nbsp; You 
took the guardianship, and gave me next to nothing.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why?&nbsp; Why is your word worth so little?&nbsp; Why did you lie about the agreement, and what you did?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">I
 took every opportunity I could get, the few that you ever allowed, to 
visit when you permitted it at my parents' house.&nbsp; For all these 
years you fought, you denied visits, you cancelled, you made 
excuses.&nbsp; We begged and begged, and if any of us ever questioned 
you or anything that you did, you threatened and carried out on 
restricting our communication and access.&nbsp; For sixteen years, you 
did this.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">When
 it became necessary to have a phone for school and communication, we 
tried reaching out, tried calling, tried texting.&nbsp; You told us that
 communication was not allowed.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">You
 lied and told others and care providers that I "wasn't following the 
visitation agreement"—though it was you, the Bruengers, who violated the
 agreement for sixteen years.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">You lied and told others and care providers that I "was violent with his mother", even though this never happened.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">For years you repeated the lie that I have ever been violent.&nbsp; Even though this is an old story:</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
 one and only time I was accused, the police threatened to charge your 
daughter with filing a false police report, because she covered her eye 
in makeup to make it look bruised.&nbsp; The paramedics were not 
impressed, and I was not charged.&nbsp; It's a matter of record.&nbsp; 
It didn't stop her from calling the police repeatedly—always because I 
was ignoring her while she screamed at me, which made her more angry—but
 she never lied to them again saying I touched her.&nbsp; If it had 
happened, obviously I would not be writing this.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">All of these things are on record.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">The Kidnapping:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">In
 October of 2010, you took and kept a member of my family from me 
without my consent, which I understand is kidnapping.&nbsp; We stood in 
your living room, and you told me that the mother had abandoned her 
child, had already signed papers giving up her rights, and you were 
trying to force me to allow you guardianship.&nbsp; When I learned the 
mother had not been involved with care for the previous four months, I 
demanded that you return my family member to me.&nbsp; You had lied to 
me for months, telling me she was still taking care of her child, while 
you hired a lawyer and drew up paperwork to try to keep us separated.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">When
 you confronted me with the guardianship papers and told me the mother 
had abandoned her child, I demanded you return this family member to 
me.&nbsp; You said no.&nbsp; I warned you that I would call the police, 
and this is what you said:</span></span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt"><strong>"Well,
 we haven't filed the papers his mother signed giving up her 
rights.&nbsp; And, she is living in the house we bought for her, just a 
few blocks away.&nbsp; If you call the police, we will call her to come 
over here first, and we will tell the police that you are lying, that 
she did not abandon him and is still taking care of him."</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">My
 family member had been legally abandoned for four months, and during 
that time you kept us separated illegally without informing me, while 
you manipulated to take and keep us apart.&nbsp; There was nothing I 
could do.&nbsp; You had taken my family member, and had already planned 
to lie to the police before they even had a chance to get there.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">In
 the years after this happened, your daughter was convicted twice for 
possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, and was 
involved in manufacturing and selling meth around St. Louis.&nbsp; I 
found out days after the separation that you had stuck her in a hotel 
room and taken away her car, in a desperate attempt to get her to detox,
 so you could successfully lie to police if I attempted to report the 
situation.&nbsp; It appeared to me that your continued financial support
 enabled her substance use, as she often asked for and received money 
while struggling with addiction.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Jan,
 you never had children of your own. Whether this was your biology or 
your husband's, nature decided that you would never be a natural mother.
 You and John tried to adopt for over fifteen years, but every single 
person you met decided you were unsuitable, that you should not be 
allowed to adopt a child.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Finally,
 after many years of being told by professionals you should not be 
parents, having nothing but money and no skill at nurturing, you began 
to obsess over being seen as a good mother. Eventually, you found a 
child who was pregnant. How long had you known her? She was only 16 
years old—Did you tell her that you would let her see her daughter? Did 
you lie to her the way you lied to me?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">You
 raised a daughter who was spiteful and materialistic, who believed that
 screaming was the appropriate way to solve problems, that screaming was
 an appropriate way to force someone to do what you wanted them to do. 
You gave her a sheltered life, cultivated her materialism and antisocial
 behavior. You failed at raising your child.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Even
 more: It seemed to me that you provided financial support to your 
daughter at a time when she was struggling with substance abuse. For 
years, I know, all she had to do was ask for the money, and you just 
kept giving it to her while her life continued to fall apart. Knowing 
that her mother was also an addict, it seems as though you did this 
intentionally, encouraging your daughter to start drinking at a young 
age, giving her money for methamphetamine and heroin.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">So,
 why did you do all of this? I've already revealed the answer: You 
desperately tried to adopt a child for over fifteen years, untold 
numbers of professionals and parents informing you that you were not 
suitable to be parents, and you became obsessed with this. Your mother 
humiliated you with comments about how you were unable to be a natural 
mother like she had been. And you became obsessed. Obsessed with being a
 mother, obsessed with being seen as someone capable of taking care of 
children—because for fifteen years, nobody believed you capable. Sadly, 
they were right.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Before
 all of this, you and John told me you had wanted a second child badly. 
But after the many years of failing to adopt, you knew there would never
 be any chance of this. So you raised a sheltered daughter, taught her 
not to take care of herself, taught her to be antisocial and unable to 
function in the real world. She still can't. And when she got pregnant, 
you were waiting to take control of her life and take that child.</span></span></p>

<p><br>
<span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Yes,
 you put your own wants above the health and well-being of others in 
your care. You exposed vulnerable people to unhealthy environments and 
influences.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">In
 my personal opinion, your longstanding pattern of seeking attention and
 control through exaggerating or fabricating disabilities and medical 
issues in those around you resembles what is clinically described as 
Munchausen syndrome by proxy (Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another). I
 am not a medical professional, but your behavior appears consistent 
with this kind of disorder, in my experience and understanding.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">But
 you know you're not a good parent. Because where is your daughter now, 
and where has she been? And what good have you done, insisting that 
others are “disabled” because you don't understand how to deal with them
 as individuals?<br>
You don't nurture, you don't encourage, you don't teach to grow. You 
cultivate dependence and your own mental illness, and you try to instill
 it on others.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">When
 you chastised others for bullying, why did you force the story to be 
changed, and insist that nothing happened? Does a kindergarten teacher 
not understand what bullying is?</span></span></p>

<p><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">You
 made decisions about family members’ care that I strongly disagree 
with, and which I believe were not in their best interest. I believe 
those in your care were capable of far more than you ever allowed.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-family:Liberation Serif,serif"><span style="font-size:12pt">Why
 did you tell others that those in your care were disabled, when they 
were not? Why did you insist on labeling capable individuals as 
disabled, with no basis for such claims? Why did you tell others that 
you were going to have guardianship extended after adulthood, based on 
this lie of disability?</span></span></p>
